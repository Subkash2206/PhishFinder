## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    *(**Note:** You should create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Run the Notebook:**
    Open the `Phishing.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to train the model and see the results.

3.  **Test a URL:**
    The final cell in the notebook contains a function to classify any URL you provide.

## Model Performance
(to be updated soon)
The final model achieved the following performance on the hold-out test set:

* **Accuracy:** `XX.XX%`
* **Precision (Phishing):** `XX.XX%`
* **Recall (Phishing):** `XX.XX%`
